# WordGuessGame

This is a fairly standard hangman game, with a hipster theme (that's your clue).

As you enter wrong answers, the stick figure hangman gets deader. Can you channel your inner-hipster before you run out of wrong guesses?

This project uses bootstrap modals to display the end-of-game win or loss. The modal is triggered by a simulated click on a hidden button.
